What is NOSQL

NOSQL != NO SQL

NOSQL = Not Only SQL

What do we want?

Performance

Scalability

Flexibility

Two important theories

CAP (Every system only can match 2 of them, NoSQL supports to match A and P)

Consistency

Availability

Tolerance to network Partitions

ACID & BASE(Anti-ACID)

ACID – RDBMS use this theory

BASE – Anti-ACID and NoSQL use it.

Compare with current RDBMS with NoSQL solutions

RDBMS are working w/ relationship, and the relationship are not easy to extend (scalability)

RDBMS software are implemented as a big system with additional function which make the database slow

ACID can make the data perfect, but it does not care about the performance.

Most of NoSQL solutions are schemaless

Make the simple things simple (for example: log)

Upcoming solutions of the software.

NoSQL is nibbling up the SQL solutions.

NoSQL + SQL = Data solution

What is the issues we are meeting now?

Performance

Document generation (PDF/Email)

Image solutions

Compare with MySQL

Performance is better

Scalability is excellent

MongoDB vs CouchDB

Similar solutions.

Performance of MongoDB is better than CouchDB

MongoDB is better at web solutions.

Three words about the MongoDB

NOSQL –> RDBMS

BSON

GridFS

How to use it?

1 Click install

2 clicks helloworld using java client

types which mongo supports now

Collection oriented database.

index using with MongoDB

GridFS for the big file

Sharding with Mongodb

How to shard?

Scalability is excellent.

Upcoming solutions for Mongodb

ORM with MongoDB java client

Performance tuning with java client

What can Mongodb  do? cannot do?

Document

Image store

Real-time Analysis

Caching

Upcoming simple desgin with Mongodb.
